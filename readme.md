# JusBot
JusBot is a general purpose discord bot to use in discord servers

## Features
- Running code blocks via the [Piston API](https://github.com/engineer-man/piston)
- Trivia quizzes
- Quotes from a variety of APIs
- WolframAlpha searches
- Weather info via [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)

## Notes
I am currently working on a v5 rewrite of the bot, so the main branch is currently stale. You can view the work in progress branch [here](https://github.com/Jus-Codin/Jus_Bot/tree/5.X.X).
